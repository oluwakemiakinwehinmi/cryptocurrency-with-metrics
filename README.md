## ABSTRACT

In this research an ensemble model with sentiment detection for foreseeing market bearings and future stand in Cryptocurrency systems was proposed. The biggest problem in the cryptocurrency market is Excessive Volatility. The prices of cryptocurrency on exchange platforms rise and fall dramatically over a short period of time. Many approaches aimed at solving this same problem are available, but most are wrought with varying inadequacies that have led to them being very terrible performers during periods of market crashes, alongside an inability to scale to predicting new coins. 


This study proposed an ensemble model using Long Term Short-Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting the rise and fall of Cryptocurrencies in a real time manner. About 5000 real time data for each of over 100 different coins were extracted from Cryptocurrency Compare Database and test was done using over 20 different coins. Python programming language via the anaconda distribution was used for the development and implementation of our model. Jupyter notebook was our IDE choice. The accuracy rate of our model is 97.56%.



Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Ensemble Model, Long Term Short-Memory, Support Vector Machine.
